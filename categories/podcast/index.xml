      <description>Show Notes Our second show was all about live streaming. This episode was jampacked with a lot of information so if you didn&amp;rsquo;t catch it all the first time around we added a lot of links below. There was so much to cover that we only went over the basics. Our next episode will be the second part of live streaming where we cover advanced topics such as adding graphics and lyrics to your stream, advanced camera adjustments, lighting, and much more.</description>
